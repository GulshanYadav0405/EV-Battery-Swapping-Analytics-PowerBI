# 📈 Sample DAX Measures

### Success Rate

```DAX
Success Rate =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(
        COUNTROWS(EV_Battery_Swap_Transactions_100000),
        EV_Battery_Swap_Transactions_100000[Status]="Success"
    ),
    COUNTROWS(EV_Battery_Swap_Transactions_100000),
0)
```

---

### Failure Rate

```DAX
Failure Rate = 1 - [Success Rate]
```

---

### Average Swap Time

```DAX
Average Swap Time =
AVERAGE(EV_Battery_Swap_Transactions_100000[Swap_Time_Minutes])
```

---

### IoT Availability

```DAX
IoT Availability =
DIVIDE([Online Devices],[Online Devices]+[Offline Devices])
```

---

### Average Delta SoC

```DAX
Average Delta SoC =
AVERAGE(
EV_Battery_Swap_Transactions_100000[Battery_SoC_After]
-
EV_Battery_Swap_Transactions_100000[Battery_SoC_Before]
)
```
